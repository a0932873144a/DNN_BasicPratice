# DNN_BasicPratice

This program will use Pytorch to show the basic of the DNN on Google Colab.

All I have to do is tune the hyper-parameters to improve this model which predict the the percentage of new tested positive cases in the future. 

And the hyper-parameters include of maximum number of epochs, mini-batch size for dataloader, learning rate of SGD, momentum for SGD, early stopping epochs, and so on.
